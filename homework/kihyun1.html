            <p class="text">The alpaca (Vicugna pacos) is a domesticated species of South American camelid. 
                Alpacas are similar to llamas, and are often confused with them. 
                The two animals are closely related, and can successfully cross-breed. 
                They are also closely related to the vicu√±a, which is believed to be the alpaca's wild ancestor, 
                and to the guanaco. There are two breeds of alpaca: the Suri alpaca and the Huacaya alpaca.
                Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of southern Peru, 
                western Bolivia, Ecuador, and northern Chile at an altitude of 3,500 m (11,500 ft) 
                to 5,000 m (16,000 ft) above sea level, throughout the year.[1] Alpacas are considerably 
                smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be beasts of burden, 
                but were bred specifically for their fiber. Alpaca fiber is used for making 
                knitted and woven items, similar to wool.
